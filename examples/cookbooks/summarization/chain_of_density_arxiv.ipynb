        "    summary=\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\",\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we leverage Claude 3 Sonnet's advanced vision capabilities to convert images from ArXiv PDFs into detailed textual descriptions. This process is crucial for creating a comprehensive text-based representation of the entire paper, including figures and diagrams.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vector Graphic Conversion**:\n",
        "   - The `convert_vector_graphic_page_to_image` function handles vector graphics in PDFs, converting them to PNG images for further processing.\n",
        "   - This step is essential for capturing complex diagrams and charts that are often present in scientific papers.\n",
        "   - If direct image extraction is not possible (e.g., for SVGs or other vector graphics), the function converts the entire page to an image.\n",
        "   - In such cases, the LLM is instructed to focus solely on describing the images on the page, ignoring any text content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Image Processing**:\n",
        "   - Two main functions, `process_figure_image` and `process_vector_image_pdf`, utilize Claude 3 Sonnet to analyze and describe images.\n",
        "   - `process_figure_image` focuses on individual figures, providing detailed technical descriptions.\n",
        "   - `process_vector_image_pdf` handles full PDF pages that may contain multiple vector graphics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Image Extraction and Description**:\n",
        "   - The `extract_images` function iterates through PDF pages, extracting both raster images and vector graphics.\n",
        "   - It calls the appropriate processing function for each image type, generating textual descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Text Integration**:\n",
        "   - `replace_images_with_descriptions` combines the extracted text from the PDF with the generated image descriptions.\n",
        "   - This creates a unified text document that includes both the original text and detailed descriptions of all visual elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "By converting images to text, we ensure that the chain of density summarization process can incorporate information from all aspects of the paper, including visual data. This comprehensive approach allows for more accurate and informative summaries, especially for papers with significant visual content."

        "The Chain of Density (CoD) summarization technique is a powerful method for creating increasingly dense and informative summaries. In this section, we'll explore how to implement CoD for ArXiv PDF summarization, including specific preprocessing and postprocessing steps to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chain of Density is an iterative approach to summarization that progressively refines and condenses information. The process involves several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Summarization**: Starting with the full document, the `summarize_current_summary` function creates an initial summary focused on a specific instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Refinement**: The `iterative_density_summarization` function repeatedly calls `summarize_current_summary`, each time taking the previous summary as input. This process:\n",
        "   - Identifies new, important technical entities or ideas from the original text\n",
        "   - Incorporates these new elements into the summary\n",
        "   - Increases overall information density while maintaining focus on the instruction\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Final Condensation**: After multiple iterations, the `final_summary` function creates an extremely dense summary, aiming to reduce length by 30-40% while retaining all critical technical content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `chain_of_density_summarization` function orchestrates this entire process:\n",

Implement torso-to-tail entity sampling for diverse entity popularity representation.\\n\\n3. Customize domains: Replace CRAG domains with support categories. Maintain dynamism mix (Real-time, Fast-changing, Slow-changing, Static) for query simulation. Implement real-time API simulation for dynamic data retrieval.\\n\\n4. Implement mock APIs: Develop KG and web search simulations. Signal-to-noise ratio <1/30. Include 2.6M+ entities in mock KG. Integrate Brave Search API for realistic web search results (up to 50 HTML pages per query).\\n\\n5. Query entity extraction: Implement domain-specific entity extraction (e.g., product names, issue types) using in-context learning with LLMs. Utilize prompt: \"You are an agent that only outputs JSON. Extract structured information from the query.\"\\n\\n6. Traffic-weighted evaluation: Apply weights based on real user interaction data. Implement equal-weighted and traffic-weighted scoring for comprehensive assessment.\\n\\n7. Metrics focus: Track Accuracy, Hallucination, Missing rates across question types, domains, dynamism. Prioritize complex queries (Multi-hop, Post-processing) and dynamic information. Analyze performance on head/torso/tail entity buckets.\\n\\n8. Latency evaluation: Measure response time, emphasizing Real-time/Fast-changing scenarios. Benchmark on A100 GPUs. Track latency for web interface (e.g., Perplexity.ai: 4,629ms) and API calls separately.\\n\\n9. Iterative improvement: Analyze performance across dimensions. Implement straightforward RAG baselines: fixed-length context window (2K tokens for smaller models, 4K for larger). Quantify improvements over LLM-only solutions (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo: 33.5% accuracy, 20.0% score).\\n\\n10. Long-tail handling: Assess performance on uncommon issues/products. Stratify entities into head/torso/tail popularity buckets. Analyze accuracy delta between head and tail entities.\\n\\n11. Comprehensive retrieval: Implement structured (KG) and unstructured (web) retrieval. Provide full HTML pages (up to 50 per query) for noise simulation. Estimate web search recall (e.g., 84% for Web Questions, 63% for KG Questions).\\n\\n12. Multi-stage evaluation: Implement validation (30%), public test (30%), private test (40%) splits. Auto-eval for rapid iteration, human-eval for final assessment. Utilize KDD Cup 2024 challenge methodology for rigorous evaluation.\\n\\n13. Prompt engineering: Develop domain-specific prompts encouraging brief, confident answers and \"I don\\'t know\" responses for low-confidence scenarios. Example: \"If you are uncertain or don\\'t know the answer, respond with \\'I don\\'t know\\'.\"\\n\\n14. Error analysis: Categorize errors into hallucination, missing information, and incorrect synthesis. Identify patterns in each category. Analyze performance across dynamism categories (e.g., Real-time: 42% for Finance domain).\\n\\n15. Cross-model comparison: Benchmark against multiple LLM bases (e.g., Llama 2/3, GPT-4) to identify model-specific strengths/weaknesses. Compare performance metrics: Llama 3 70B Instruct (Accuracy: 32.3%, Score: 3.4%) vs. GPT-4 Turbo (Accuracy: 33.5%, Score: 20.0%).\\n\\n16. Industry SOTA comparison: Evaluate against top-performing RAG systems (e.g., Copilot Pro: 62.6% perfect answers, 50.6% score). Analyze performance gaps in specific question types and dynamism categories.\\n\\n17. Mock KG design: Create domain-specific KGs with 2.6M+ entities. Include \"hard negative\" entities with similar names for realistic retrieval challenges. Implement mock APIs (e.g., get_price_history(ticker) for financial queries).\\n\\n18. Dynamism-aware evaluation: Stratify questions by dynamism (Real-time: 10%, Fast-changing: 13%, Slow-changing: 23%, Static: 54%). Assess RAG system\\'s ability to handle temporal dynamics in customer support contexts.\\n\\n19. False premise detection: Evaluate system\\'s capability to identify and respond to queries with false assumptions (12% of CRAG questions). Implement specific scoring for these scenarios.\\n\\n20. Retrieval augmentation analysis: Compare performance across Tasks 1 (web-only), 2 (web + KG), and 3 (expanded web + KG). Quantify improvements from each retrieval expansion (e.g., Task 3 GPT-4 Turbo: 43.6% accuracy vs. 33.5% LLM-only).\\n\\nBy adapting CRAG\\'s comprehensive methodology, create a domain-specific, highly technical evaluation framework for your customer support RAG system. This approach ensures robust assessment of information retrieval and response generation across diverse support scenarios, with particular emphasis on handling dynamic information, long-tail queries, and complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.']}"

Further analysis reveals many-shot ICL can overcome pretraining biases, perform comparably to fine-tuning, and learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs where few-shot struggles.

Analysis uncovers many-shot ICL's ability to overcome pretraining biases, perform on par with fine-tuning, and learn high-dimensional numerical functions where few-shot struggles, though order sensitivity is a key challenge. Comparison to supervised fine-tuning on low-resource machine translation positions many-shot ICL as a viable alternative. The work establishes a foundation for understanding and optimizing long-context models for ICL, highlighting the potential to reduce fine-tuning reliance and increase language model versatility.

            "This work achieves significant many-shot in-context learning (ICL) performance gains by scaling up to 8192 shots with Gemini 1.5 Pro's 1M token context on diverse reasoning, planning, and language tasks. Novel methodological contributions include Reinforced ICL, prompting with filtered model-generated rationales, and Unsupervised ICL, prompting only domain-specific inputs. Both enable effective few-shot complex reasoning even without human demonstrations, with iterative Reinforced ICL yielding further improvements. Many-shot ICL overcomes pretraining biases, matches supervised fine-tuning, learns high-dimensional synthetic classification and sequential parity prediction functions outperforming k-nearest neighbors and GPT-2 trained on 20x more data, and exhibits shot order sensitivity varying across mathematical subareas. On low-resource machine translation, it surpasses state-of-the-art models, providing an inference-only alternative to fine-tuning. However, next-token prediction loss proves unreliable for ICL performance on problem-solving and reasoning. Evaluating frontier LLMs reveals varying many-shot capability, proposing it as a key metric for language model development. These innovations reduce fine-tuning reliance, advance ICL methodologies, and establish many-shot learning as a crucial component in increasing large language model versatility and robustness.\n",

            "This research pioneers Reinforced ICL with model-generated rationales, outperforming humans on BBH algorithmic reasoning (83% vs. 72%), and Unsupervised ICL using only inputs, enabling complex reasoning without demonstrations. Many-shot ICL with 8192 shots and 1M token context matches supervised fine-tuning on diverse tasks, overcoming pretraining biases. It learns high-dimensional synthetic classification and sequential parity prediction, improves planning success rate from 15% to 35% on Logistics domains, matches PEGASUS/mT5 summarization, and surpasses state-of-the-art low-resource MT. However, many-shot order sensitivity varies up to 10% between mathematical subareas, and next-token loss proves unreliable for problem-solving ICL. Frontier LLM evaluation reveals Gemini 1.5 Pro's many-shot outperforms few-shot GPT-4 and Claude-3. These methodological innovations advance ICL, reduce fine-tuning reliance, and establish many-shot learning as crucial for language model versatility and robustness.\n",

            "This work proposes SliCK, a taxonomy to quantify LLM knowledge using P(Correct), a continuous measure of model likelihood of accurate generation. It demonstrates that fine-tuning on Unknown examples (facts likely unknown to the model) correlates linearly with increased hallucinations, while LLMs struggle to acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, instead learning to better utilize pre-existing knowledge. Filtering Unknown fine-tuning examples mitigates overfitting without sacrificing performance. Compared to existing work focused on knowledge acquisition, this novel perspective highlights fine-tuning's greater utility in enhancing utilization of pre-existing knowledge. As a case study, the paper analyzes the P(True) metric and shows that re-labeling Unknown examples as \"I don't know\" can further reduce overfitting, providing a promising direction for knowledge-aware fine-tuning.\n",

To overcome the challenge of requiring high-quality human-written rationales, the authors propose Reinforced ICL, which uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales, and Unsupervised ICL, which removes rationales altogether and prompts the model only with domain-specific inputs. They find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that many-shot ICL can overcome pretraining biases, perform comparably to fine-tuning, and learn high-dimensional numerical prediction tasks where few-shot ICL struggles.

Additionally, the authors introduce Unsupervised ICL, wherein only domain inputs are provided, outperforming supervised ICL on tasks demanding deeper reasoning. Crucially, they reveal many-shot ICL's ability to overcome pretraining biases, learn high-dimensional functions, and match fine-tuning performance, suggesting enhanced model adaptability. Finally, the work establishes limitations of next-token loss as an indicator of ICL capabilities, particularly on problem-solving domains.\n",

SliCK utilizes a continuous PCorrect measure based on model-generated samples to classify facts into four categories: HighlyKnown, MaybeKnown, WeaklyKnown, and Unknown. This categorization enables a controlled study on the impact of new knowledge introduced during fine-tuning on large language models' (LLMs) tendency to hallucinate.\n",
            "\n",
            "The study's key methodological contribution is the design of fine-tuning dataset variants with varying proportions of Unknown examples while controlling for other factors. This approach isolates the effect of new knowledge on model performance. The research demonstrates that higher ratios of Unknown examples in the fine-tuning data lead to performance degradation, which is linearly correlated with the model's tendency to hallucinate with respect to its pre-existing knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "A significant finding is that Unknown examples are fitted substantially slower than Known examples during fine-tuning. This suggests that LLMs struggle to integrate new factual knowledge through fine-tuning and primarily learn to utilize their pre-existing knowledge more effectively. The study also reveals that the negative impact of Unknown examples manifests as a form of overfitting in later training stages, which can be mitigated through early stopping or filtering out Unknown examples from the fine-tuning dataset.\n",
            "\n",
            "The research provides empirical evidence supporting the view that LLMs mostly acquire factual knowledge through pre-training, while fine-tuning enhances the utilization of pre-existing knowledge. This finding has potential implications for fine-tuning practices and the development of more robust LLMs.\n",

This approach allows for isolating the effect of new knowledge introduction during fine-tuning.

            "The paper addresses current limitations in understanding how LLMs integrate new knowledge by providing empirical evidence that acquiring new facts through fine-tuning correlates with increased hallucinations regarding pre-existing knowledge. This finding challenges the common practice of using supervised fine-tuning to update LLMs' knowledge bases.\n",

        "This section introduces an advanced technique to enhance the Chain of Density (CoD) summarization process for ArXiv PDFs. By incorporating a chunking mechanism, we can handle longer documents more effectively and potentially improve the quality of our summaries. Here's an overview of the augmented CoD summarization process:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Augmented Chain of Density Summarization\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chunk the Text**: We split the input text into manageable chunks using the `chunk_text` function. This function intelligently handles document structure, including image descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Chunk Summarization**: For each chunk, we apply the CoD process using `summarize_chunk`. This creates summaries for individual sections of the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Combine Chunk Summaries**: We use `summarize_chunk_summaries` to integrate information from all chunk summaries into a cohesive whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Refinement**: We repeat steps 2-3 for a specified number of iterations (`chunk_iterations`) to progressively refine the summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Density Pass**: After chunk-based summarization, we apply the standard CoD process to further refine and densify the final summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key components of this process include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `chunk_text`: Splits the document into manageable pieces.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk`: Applies CoD to individual chunks.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk_summaries`: Combines chunk summaries.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk_iteration`: Manages the iteration process for chunk summarization.\n",
        "- `iterative_chunk_summarization`: Orchestrates the entire chunk-based summarization process.\n",
        "- `chain_of_density_summarization`: Integrates chunking with the final CoD refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "This augmented approach allows us to:\n",
        "1. Handle longer documents more effectively.\n",
        "2. Potentially capture more nuanced information from different parts of the paper.\n",
        "3. Provide a more comprehensive summary that considers the entire document structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline` class has been updated to incorporate these new features, allowing for easy experimentation with different chunk sizes and iteration counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we've also extended our `quality_scorer` function to analyze the chunk-based summaries separately. This gives us insights into how the chunking process affects summary quality at different stages of the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using this augmented CoD approach, we aim to create more comprehensive and accurate summaries of ArXiv papers, especially for longer or more complex documents."
