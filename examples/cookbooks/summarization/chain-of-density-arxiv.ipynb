    "    summary=\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\",\n",

    "1. Relevance (0-10):\n",

    "     Example: \"The paper introduces a novel Chain of Density (CoD) approach for text summarization, iteratively refining summaries to increase information density while maintaining coherence.\"\n",

    "   - 4-5: Partially addresses the instruction, missing significant aspects of methodologies or contributions\n",

    "   - 2-3: Barely addresses the instruction, focusing on tangential information\n",
    "     Example: \"The research explores various natural language processing tasks, including text summarization.\"\n",
    "   - 0-1: Completely irrelevant to the instruction\n",
    "     Example: \"The paper discusses advancements in computer vision algorithms for image recognition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Technical Quality (0-10):\n",
    "   - 10: Exceptionally accurate, detailed, and technically sound, with precise descriptions of methodologies and contributions\n",
    "     Example: \"The Chain of Density approach employs a multi-step refinement process, using GPT-4 to iteratively increase information density. Each iteration aims to reduce length by 20-30% while preserving key information, resulting in progressively denser summaries.\"\n",
    "   - 8-9: Highly accurate with comprehensive technical details about research methods and findings\n",
    "     Example: \"The CoD method uses large language models to refine summaries over multiple iterations, with each step aiming to increase information density by 20-30% while maintaining coherence.\"\n",
    "   - 6-7: Generally accurate with good technical depth, but may lack some specifics\n",
    "     Example: \"The proposed summarization technique uses iterative refinement to increase information density in generated summaries, leveraging large language models in the process.\"\n",
    "   - 4-5: Mostly accurate but lacks important technical details about methodologies or contributions\n",
    "     Example: \"The study presents a new summarization method that aims to improve summary quality through multiple refinement steps.\"\n",
    "   - 2-3: Contains technical inaccuracies or lacks significant depth in describing research approaches\n",

    "   - 0-1: Technically unsound or extremely superficial in describing methodologies and contributions\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Conciseness (0-10):\n",
    "   - 10: Maximally information-dense without any unnecessary content, perfectly balancing detail and brevity\n",
    "     Example: \"CoD: Novel iterative summarization method. GPT-4 refines summaries, increasing density 20-30% per iteration. Outperforms baselines in human evaluation.\"\n",
    "   - 8-9: Highly concise with minimal extraneous information, efficiently describing methodologies and contributions\n",
    "     Example: \"Chain of Density: Iterative summarization technique using GPT-4. Progressively increases information density while maintaining coherence. Superior to baselines in human studies.\"\n",
    "   - 6-7: Generally concise but could be slightly more compact in describing research approaches\n",
    "     Example: \"The paper introduces Chain of Density, a new summarization method that uses multiple refinement steps to increase information density in summaries. It shows improvements over existing techniques.\"\n",
    "   - 4-5: Contains some unnecessary information or repetition, diluting the focus on key methodologies and contributions\n",
    "     Example: \"The research presents a new approach to summarization called Chain of Density. This method aims to make summaries more informative by refining them multiple times. The authors conducted experiments to show that their method works better than other existing methods.\"\n",
    "   - 2-3: Verbose with significant redundancy, obscuring the main research points\n",
    "     Example: \"In this paper, the authors talk about a new way to make summaries of text. They call their method Chain of Density. The idea is to take a summary and make it better by refining it multiple times. They use AI to do this. They say their method is better than other methods that exist currently.\"\n",
    "   - 0-1: Extremely verbose or filled with irrelevant information unrelated to methodologies and contributions\n",
