    "    summary=\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\",\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we leverage Claude 3 Sonnet's advanced vision capabilities to convert images from ArXiv PDFs into detailed textual descriptions. This process is crucial for creating a comprehensive text-based representation of the entire paper, including figures and diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Graphic Conversion**: \n",
    "   - The `convert_vector_graphic_page_to_image` function handles vector graphics in PDFs, converting them to PNG images for further processing.\n",
    "   - This step is essential for capturing complex diagrams and charts that are often present in scientific papers.\n",
    "   - If direct image extraction is not possible (e.g., for SVGs or other vector graphics), the function converts the entire page to an image.\n",
    "   - In such cases, the LLM is instructed to focus solely on describing the images on the page, ignoring any text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Processing**:\n",
    "   - Two main functions, `process_figure_image` and `process_vector_image_pdf`, utilize Claude 3 Sonnet to analyze and describe images.\n",
    "   - `process_figure_image` focuses on individual figures, providing detailed technical descriptions.\n",
    "   - `process_vector_image_pdf` handles full PDF pages that may contain multiple vector graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Image Extraction and Description**:\n",
    "   - The `extract_images` function iterates through PDF pages, extracting both raster images and vector graphics.\n",
    "   - It calls the appropriate processing function for each image type, generating textual descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Integration**:\n",
    "   - `replace_images_with_descriptions` combines the extracted text from the PDF with the generated image descriptions.\n",
    "   - This creates a unified text document that includes both the original text and detailed descriptions of all visual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting images to text, we ensure that the chain of density summarization process can incorporate information from all aspects of the paper, including visual data. This comprehensive approach allows for more accurate and informative summaries, especially for papers with significant visual content."

    "\n",
    "The Chain of Density (CoD) summarization technique is a powerful method for creating increasingly dense and informative summaries. In this section, we'll explore how to implement CoD for ArXiv PDF summarization, including specific preprocessing and postprocessing steps to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Density is an iterative approach to summarization that progressively refines and condenses information. The process involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Summarization**: Starting with the full document, the `summarize_current_summary` function creates an initial summary focused on a specific instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Refinement**: The `iterative_density_summarization` function repeatedly calls `summarize_current_summary`, each time taking the previous summary as input. This process:\n",
    "   - Identifies new, important technical entities or ideas from the original text\n",
    "   - Incorporates these new elements into the summary\n",
    "   - Increases overall information density while maintaining focus on the instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Condensation**: After multiple iterations, the `final_summary` function creates an extremely dense summary, aiming to reduce length by 30-40% while retaining all critical technical content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chain_of_density_summarization` function orchestrates this entire process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@weave.op()\n",
    "def chain_of_density_summarization(document, instruction, current_summary=\"\", model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\", density_iterations=2):\n",
    "    current_summary, iteration_summaries = iterative_density_summarization(document, instruction, current_summary, density_iterations, model)\n",
    "    final_summary_text = final_summary(instruction, current_summary, model)\n",
    "    print(f\"Final Summary:\\n{final_summary_text}\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        \"final_summary\": final_summary_text,\n",
    "        \"accumulated_summary\": current_summary,\n",
    "        \"iteration_summaries\": iteration_summaries,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes the preprocessed document, a specific instruction to focus on, the model to use, and the number of density iterations. It returns a dictionary containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final, highly condensed summary\n",
    "- The accumulated summary from all iterations\n",
    "- Individual summaries from each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this approach, Chain of Density creates summaries that are progressively more concise, technically precise, and information-dense, while remaining focused on the specific instruction provided. This makes it particularly well-suited for summarizing complex technical documents like ArXiv papers, where maintaining accuracy and depth of information is crucial."

    "## Create our Evaluation Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we prepare a dataset for evaluating our Chain of Density (CoD) summarization pipeline on ArXiv papers. This dataset will allow us to assess the performance of our model across different papers and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample ArXiv Papers**: We create `ArxivPaper` objects for three different papers:\n",
    "   - `arxiv_paper1`: \"Does Fine-Tuning LLMs on New Knowledge Encourage Hallucinations?\"\n",
    "   - `arxiv_paper2`: \"Many-Shot In-Context Learning\"\n",
    "   - `arxiv_paper3`: \"LLMs instead of Human Judges? A Large Scale Empirical Study across 20 NLP Evaluation Tasks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each `ArxivPaper` object contains metadata such as title, authors, summary, and PDF URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Instructions**: We define a list of instructions that will guide the summarization process:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   eval_instructions = [\n",
    "       \"Summarize the key methodologies and novel contributions of this research, focusing on their potential impact in the field.\",\n",
    "       \"Analyze the experimental setup, results, and limitations of this study, highlighting any statistical significance and error margins.\",\n",
    "       \"Compare this paper's approach to existing methods in the field, explaining how it addresses current challenges or limitations.\"\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Evaluation Data**: We use `itertools.product()` to create combinations of papers and instructions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   eval_data = list(product(eval_papers, eval_instructions))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weave Dataset**: Finally, we create a Weave Dataset object that combines the paper, instruction, and original summary for each evaluation item:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   dataset = weave.Dataset(name=\"we-paper-reading-eval-data\", \n",
    "                           rows=[{\"paper\": arxiv_paper, \n",
    "                                  \"instruction\": instruction, \n",
    "                                  \"summary\": arxiv_paper.summary} \n",
    "                                 for arxiv_paper, instruction in eval_data])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Publishing the Dataset**: We publish the dataset to make it available for evaluation:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   weave.publish(dataset)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation dataset provides a structured way to assess our CoD summarization pipeline across different papers and instructions, allowing for comprehensive testing of the model's performance and adaptability."

    "     - Relevance (0-5): How well the summary addresses the given instruction\n",
    "     - Technical Quality (0-5): Accuracy and depth of technical content\n",
    "     - Conciseness (0-5): Information density and brevity\n",
    "   - Uses GPT-4 to perform the evaluation, ensuring a nuanced assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Long-tail Statistics (`calculate_long_tail_stats`)**:\n",
    "   - Analyzes the distribution of scores across multiple summaries\n",
    "   - Calculates mean scores and tail ratios for each aspect (relevance, technical quality, conciseness)\n",
    "   - Helps identify overall performance and potential outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration Impact Analysis (`analyze_iteration_impact`)**:\n",
    "   - Assesses the improvement of summaries across iterations\n",
    "   - Identifies the point of diminishing returns and cumulative improvement\n",
    "   - Useful for optimizing the number of iterations in the CoD process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal Improvement Range (`find_optimal_improvement_range`)**:\n",
    "   - Determines the most effective range of iterations for improvement\n",
    "   - Considers moving averages of improvements to find sustained progress\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optimal Score Range (`find_optimal_score_range`)**:\n",
    "   - Identifies the iteration range that produces the highest quality summaries\n",
    "   - Helps in fine-tuning the CoD process for maximum effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iteration Summary Processing (`process_iteration_summaries`)**:\n",
    "   - Aggregates and analyzes scores across all iterations\n",
    "   - Provides a holistic view of the summarization process's progression\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Quality Scorer (`quality_scorer`)**:\n",
    "   - Combines all the above metrics into a comprehensive evaluation\n",
    "   - Analyzes iteration summaries, accumulated summary, and final summary\n",
    "   - Produces a flattened, easy-to-analyze score dictionary"

      "This paper presents JUDGE-BENCH, a comprehensive collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations, to empirically evaluate the ability of 11 state-of-the-art open-weight and proprietary large language models (LLMs) to replicate human judgments across a diverse range of NLP tasks. The evaluation spans datasets varying in the type of task (e.g., translation, dialogue generation), the property being judged (e.g., coherence, fluency), the type of judgments (categorical or graded), and the expertise of human annotators (experts or non-experts). Spearman's correlation is computed for graded annotations and Cohen's kappa for categorical annotations to quantify the alignment between LLM and human judgments. Key findings include: (1) Each LLM exhibits substantial variance in correlation with human judgments across datasets; (2) GPT-4o ranks first overall, with open models Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x22B as close seconds; (3) LLMs demonstrate higher correlation with non-expert annotations compared to expert annotations; (4) LLM performance varies across different properties being judged, with no single model excelling at all properties; (5) LLMs align better with human judgments when evaluating human-generated text compared to machine-generated text. The authors conclude that current LLMs are not yet ready to systematically replace human judges and caution against using LLMs for NLP evaluation without calibration against human judgments on each new dataset. JUDGE-BENCH is released as a living benchmark to facilitate future extensions and evaluations as new LLMs emerge.\n",

      "This work presents JUDGE-BENCH, a comprehensive open-source benchmark encompassing 20 diverse NLP datasets with human annotations, to rigorously evaluate the capacity of 11 state-of-the-art open-weight and proprietary large language models (LLMs) to approximate human judges across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks. The evaluation spans datasets varying in task domain (e.g., machine translation, dialogue generation, summarization, instruction following via the LLMBar dataset), assessed property (e.g., coherence, fluency, toxicity), annotation type (categorical or graded), and annotator expertise (expert or non-expert). Spearman's correlation for graded annotations and Cohen's kappa for categorical annotations quantify LLM-human judgment alignment. Key findings include: (1) high per-LLM variance in human correlation across datasets; (2) GPT-4o leading overall, closely trailed by open models Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x22B, indicating a diminishing gap between open and closed models; (3) stronger LLM correlation with non-expert vs. expert annotations; (4) LLM performance fluctuating across judged properties, no single model dominating all categories; (5) superior LLM alignment with human judgments on human-generated vs. machine-generated text. The authors conclude current LLMs are not yet reliable substitutes for human judges and advise against deploying LLMs for NLP evaluation without per-dataset calibration against human judgments. JUDGE-BENCH, with its released code base to facilitate future extensions as new LLMs emerge, constitutes a valuable resource for the NLP community to track the evolving landscape of LLM-based evaluation. The inclusion of the LLMBar dataset for assessing instruction-following abilities and the narrowing gap between open and closed models represent noteworthy methodological and empirical contributions, highlighting the benchmark's potential to drive impactful research in this rapidly advancing domain.\n",

    "## Optional: Deeper Analysis of Summary Refinement using Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces an advanced technique to enhance the Chain of Density (CoD) summarization process for ArXiv PDFs. By incorporating a chunking mechanism, we can handle longer documents more effectively and potentially improve the quality of our summaries. Here's an overview of the augmented CoD summarization process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmented Chain of Density Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chunk the Text**: We split the input text into manageable chunks using the `chunk_text` function. This function intelligently handles document structure, including image descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Chunk Summarization**: For each chunk, we apply the CoD process using `summarize_chunk`. This creates summaries for individual sections of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine Chunk Summaries**: We use `summarize_chunk_summaries` to integrate information from all chunk summaries into a cohesive whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Refinement**: We repeat steps 2-3 for a specified number of iterations (`chunk_iterations`) to progressively refine the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Density Pass**: After chunk-based summarization, we apply the standard CoD process to further refine and densify the final summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of this process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_text`: Splits the document into manageable pieces.\n",
    "- `summarize_chunk`: Applies CoD to individual chunks.\n",
    "- `summarize_chunk_summaries`: Combines chunk summaries.\n",
    "- `summarize_chunk_iteration`: Manages the iteration process for chunk summarization.\n",
    "- `iterative_chunk_summarization`: Orchestrates the entire chunk-based summarization process.\n",
    "- `chain_of_density_summarization`: Integrates chunking with the final CoD refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This augmented approach allows us to:\n",
    "1. Handle longer documents more effectively.\n",
    "2. Potentially capture more nuanced information from different parts of the paper.\n",
    "3. Provide a more comprehensive summary that considers the entire document structure.\n",
    "\n",
