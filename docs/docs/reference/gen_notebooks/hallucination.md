## Evaluating hallucination in RAG Pipelines with Weave Integration

This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate hallucination of language models in answers coming from a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) response. We will integrate this with Weave for tracking function inputs and outputs, creating objects out of prompts, and running evaluations with different datasets.

Objectives:

* Implement a RAG pipeline that includes  hallucination detection mechanism using an open source ML model trained specifically for hallucination detection.
* Integrate Weave to track all function calls, inputs, and outputs.
* Register three different evaluation datasets and showcase evaluation steps.

Stack Used:

* OpenAI API for language models and embeddings.
* Weave by Weights & Biases for tracking and evaluation.
* open source hallucination_evaluation_model from hugging face

Note:Ensure you have the necessary API keys set up in your environment.


See the full Weave documentation [here](https://wandb.me/weave).

## ü™Ñ Install Dependencies

Start by installing the library and logging in to your account.

In this example, we're using openai so you should [add an openai API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key).


```python
%%capture
!pip install weave \
openai set-env-colab-kaggle-dotenv \
requests \
python-dotenv==1.0.1 \
PyPDF2 \
unstructured \
pdfminer.six \
transformers \
nltk \
torch \
llama-index
```

```python
# Set your OpenAI API key
from set_env import set_env

# Put your OPENAI_API_KEY in the secrets panel to the left üóùÔ∏è
_ = set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..." # alternatively, put your key here

PROJECT = "Hallucination_Check"

```

```python
import weave                    # import the weave library
weave.init(PROJECT)      # initialize tracking for a specific W&B project

```

## üìö Import Necessary Libraries

We'll import all the required libraries for our project:

```python

import os
from openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex,SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from typing import List, Dict, Any
import weave
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download NLTK data for sentence tokenization

```

Loading Hallucination detection model:

```python
%%capture

# Load the model with custom code
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model", trust_remote_code=True
)
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

```

## üîë Initialize OpenAI Client and Embedding Model

Create an OpenAI client instance for API calls and set up the embedding model.

```python
# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)

# Set up embedding model
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbedding(model="text-embedding-ada-002")


```

## üì• Download and Load Documents

We'll download a PDF document from a URL and create an index using LlamaIndex. Please note taht this can be your own vector database with your data indexed for your RAG Chatbot.

```python

# Download the PDF from a URL
pdf_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13296v1.pdf"  # Replace with your PDF URL
pdf_filename = "document.pdf"

response = requests.get(pdf_url)
with open(pdf_filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)

# Load the documents from the PDF
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir='.', required_exts=['.pdf']).load_data()

# Create the index from the documents
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, embed_model=embedding_model)

```


## üîé Create Query Engine

Set up the query engine with a limit on the number of retrieved documents.

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Define Weave-Tracked Functions

We'll define our functions for the pipeline and use `@weave.op()` to decorate them, enabling Weave to track their inputs and outputs.

### 1. Retrieve Context

This function retrieves relevant context for the question using the LlamaIndex query engine.


```python
@weave.op()
def retrieve_context(question: str) -> str:
    '''
    Retrieves relevant context for the question using LlamaIndex query engine.
    '''
    response = query_engine.query(question)
    context = str(response)
    return context
```

### 2. Generate Answer

This function generates an answer to the question based on the provided context using OpenAI's GPT model.



```python
@weave.op()
def generate_answer(question: str, context: str, model_name: str) -> str:
    '''
    Generates an answer to the question based on the provided context using OpenAI's GPT model.
    '''

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion:\n{question}"}
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.7,
        n=1,
    )
    answer = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return answer


```

### 3. Break Down Answer into Statements

This function breaks down the answer into simpler statements without pronouns.

```python
weave.op()
def break_down_answer_into_statements(answer: str, model_name: str) -> List[str]:
    '''
    Breaks down the answer into simpler statements without pronouns.
    '''

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You simplify answers into fully understandable statements without pronouns."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Break down the following answer into a list of simpler statements, ensuring each statement is fully understandable and contains no pronouns.\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nStatements:"}
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=300,
        temperature=0.5,
        n=1,
    )
    statements_text = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    # Parse statements as a list
    statements = [s.strip().strip('.').strip() for s in statements_text.split('\n') if s.strip()]
    # Remove any numbering or bullets
    statements = [s.lstrip('0123456789.- ') for s in statements]
    return statements

```

### 4. Detect statement Hallucination


```python
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from typing import Dict, Any


@weave.op()
def check_statement_hallucination(context: str, statement: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    '''
    Detects hallucination in the answer using the provided context and model answer.
    '''

    #statements = sent_tokenize(statement)
    #pairs = [(context, statement) for statement in statements]
    pairs = [(context, statement)]


    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.predict(pairs)
        # The outputs are probabilities, we round them to get binary predictions
        preds = torch.round(outputs)


    for pair, pred in zip(pairs, preds):
        result = {
            'statement': pair[1],
            'prediction': 1 if pred.item() == 1.0 else 0
        }


    return result
```


## üìä Register Evaluation Dataset

We'll create and register a single evaluation dataset in Weave. This dataset will be used to evaluate the faithfulness of the generated answers.


```python
# Define the dataset
dataset = weave.Dataset(
    name="Hallucination_Evaluation_Dataset",
    rows=[
        {"question": "What are the limitations of the Transformers library and Trainer API?"},
        {"question": "How Azure Open AI fine-tuning is different from Open AI fine tuning"},
        {"question": "Why fine-tuning GPT-4 is more challenging than GPT-3.5"},
        {"question": "Explain why fine-tuning is cheaper compared to few shot learning?"},
        {"question": "How we can fine tune the new GPT o1 preview model? ( not that this is a different model compared to GPT-01)"},
    ],
)

# Publish dataset to Weave
weave.publish(dataset)


```

## üß™ Define End-to-End Pipeline as a Weave Model

We'll define an end-to-end pipeline as a Weave Model. This allows us to use it for evaluation later and makes the entire process reproducible and traceable.


```python


class HallucinationEvaluator(weave.Model):
    model_name: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

    @weave.op()
    def predict(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        '''
        Generates an answer to the question based on retrieved context.
        Returns a dict with 'answer', 'context', and 'model_name'.
        '''
        # Retrieve context
        context = retrieve_context(question)
        # Generate answer
        answer = generate_answer(question, context, self.model_name)
        return {'answer': answer, 'context': context, 'model_name': self.model_name}

```

## üìù Define Scorer Function

We'll define a scorer function that computes the faithfulness score of the model's answer. This function will be used by Weave's `Evaluation` class.


```python

@weave.op()
def hallucination_scorer(model_output: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    '''
    Scorer function that computes the factual score of the model's answer for evaluating hallucination.
    '''
    answer = model_output['answer']
    context = model_output['context']
    model_name = model_output['model_name']
    statements = break_down_answer_into_statements(answer, model_name)
    total_statements = len(statements)
    factual_statements = 0
    statement_results = []
    for statement in statements:
        result = check_statement_hallucination(context, answer)
        factual_statements += result['prediction']
        statement_results.append({
            'prediction': result['prediction'],
            'statement': result['statement']
        })
    # Calculate faithfulness score
    if total_statements > 0:
        factual_score = factual_statements / total_statements
    else:
        factual_score = 0
    # Return results
    return {
        'factual_score': factual_score,
        'statement_results': statement_results,
    }

```

## üöÄ Run Evaluation Using Weave's `Evaluation` Class

We'll use Weave's `Evaluation` class to run the evaluation, ensuring that the results are stored in the **'eval'** section of Weave.


```python
# Import Weave's Evaluation class
from weave import Evaluation

# Initialize Weave
weave.init(PROJECT)

# Apply nest_asyncio to allow nested event loops in Colab
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Run the evaluation for both models
import asyncio

# Define the models to evaluate
model_names = ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o"]

for model_name in model_names:
    print(f"Running evaluation with model: {model_name}")
    # Instantiate the evaluator model with the specified model name
    evaluator_model = HallucinationEvaluator(model_name=model_name)

    # Define the evaluation
    evaluation = Evaluation(
        dataset=dataset,  # the dataset we have defined earlier
        scorers=[hallucination_scorer],  # the scorer function
    )

    # Run the evaluation
    summary = asyncio.run(evaluation.evaluate(evaluator_model))

    print(f"Completed evaluation with model: {model_name}\n")

```

## üìå Conclusion

**Evaluation of Faithfulness**:

In this notebook, we focused on evaluating the **faithfulness** of answers generated by our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. By breaking down the answers into simpler
statements and checking each one against the retrieved context, we quantified how much we can
**trust** the responses provided by the system.

 **How Weave Helps**:

 Weave played a crucial role in this process by:

 - **Tracking**: Weave's `@weave.op()` decorators allowed us to track the inputs and outputs of our
   functions seamlessly. This provided transparency into each step of our pipeline.
 - **Evaluation**: Using Weave's `Evaluation` class, we conducted structured evaluations and stored
   the results in the **'eval'** section. This made it easy to analyze and compare results.
 - **Reproducibility**: By defining our prompts and models as Weave Objects and Models, we ensured
   that our pipeline is reproducible and easily shareable.

 **Benefits of Weave Integration**:

 - **Enhanced Trust**: By integrating faithfulness evaluation, we added an extra layer of **trust** to
   our system. Users can be more confident in the accuracy of the responses.
 - **Debugging and Improvement**: Weave's tracking capabilities make it easier to identify areas
  where the model may not be performing as expected, facilitating targeted improvements.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: The ability to store and analyze evaluation results within Weave
   provides comprehensive insights into model performance over time.

 ## üîö Final Thoughts

 By integrating **Weave** into our code, we've enhanced the transparency, reliability, and
 **trustworthiness** of our RAG system. We can:

 - Track function inputs and outputs.
 - Reuse prompt templates as Weave Objects.
 - Perform comprehensive evaluations focused on faithfulness.
 - Define an end-to-end pipeline as a Weave Model for easier evaluation.
 - Store evaluation results in the **'eval'** section of Weave for better analysis.

 This approach not only provides valuable insights into the trustworthiness of the generated
 answers but also contributes to building systems that users can rely on with confidence.
