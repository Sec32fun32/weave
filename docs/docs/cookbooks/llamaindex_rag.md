# RAG Chatbot to assist an English Teacher

In this tutorial, we'll build a chatbot to assist a teacher with grading student assignments and help clarify student questions regarding the syllabus and study materials using **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**.

We'll build our RAG chatbot with these tools:

- LlamaIndex as the data framework for building the RAG application
- Groq as an LLM vendor
- Instructor to get structured output with a consistent schema from our LLM 
- Weave for tracking and evaluating LLM applications
