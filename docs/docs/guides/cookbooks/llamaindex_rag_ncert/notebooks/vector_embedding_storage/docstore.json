It ruined my fishing trips; deprived me of the joy of\ncanoeing, boating, and swimming.\nI used every way I knew to over come this fear , but it\nheld me fir mly in its grip. Finally, one October , I decided to\nget an instructor and learn to swim. I went to a pool and\npracticed five days a week, an hour each day. The instructor\nput a belt around me. A rope attached to the belt went\nthrough a pulley that ran on an overhead cable. He held on\nto the end of the rope, and we went back and forth, back\nand forth acr oss the pool, hour after hour , day after day,\nweek after week. On each trip across the pool a bit of the\npanic seized me. Each time the instructor relaxed his hold\non the r ope and I went under , some of the old terr or returned\nand my legs froze. It was three months before the tension\nbegan to slack. Then he taught me to put my face under\nwater and exhale, and to raise my nose and inhale. I repeated\nthe exercise hundreds of times. Bit by bit I shed part of the\npanic that seized me when my head went under water .\nNext he held me at the side of the pool and had me\nkick with my legs.  For weeks I did just that. At first my\nlegs refused to work. But they gradually relaxed; and finally\nI could command them.\nThus, piece by piece, he built a swimmer . And when he\nhad perfected each piece, he put them together into an\nintegrated whole. In April he said, \u201cNow you can swim. Dive\noff and swim the length of the pool, crawl stroke.\u201d\nI did. The instructor was finished.\nBut I was not finished. I still wondered if I would be\nterror-stricken when I was alone in the pool. I tried it. I\nswam the length up and down. T iny vestiges of the old\nterror would return. But now I could frown and say to that\nterror, \u201cTrying to scar e me, eh? W ell, her e\u2019s to you!

In the backyard, where lived the new priest, there\nwere red and white plastic chairs. A young boy dressed in a\ngrey uniform, wearing socks and shoes, arrived panting and\nthrew his school bag on a folding bed. Looking at the boy, I\nremembered the prayer another boy had made to the goddess\nwhen he had finally got a pair of shoes , \u201cLet me never lose\nthem.\u201d The goddess had granted his prayer . Young boys like\nthe son of the priest now wore shoes. But many others like\nthe ragpickers in my neighbourhood remain shoeless.\nMy acquaintance with the barefoot ragpickers leads\nme to Seemapuri, a place on the periphery of Delhi yet miles\naway from it, metaphorically. Those who live here are\nsquatters who came from Bangladesh back in 1971. Saheb\u2019s\nfamily is among them. Seemapuri was then a wilderness. It\nstill is, but it is no longer empty. In structures of mud, with\nroofs of tin and tarpaulin, devoid of sewage, drainage or\nrunning water , live 10,000 ragpickers. They have lived her e\nfor more than thirty years without an identity, without\npermits but with ration cards that get their names on voters\u2019\nlists and enable them to buy grain. Food is more important\nfor survival than an identity. \u201cIf at the end of the day we\ncan feed our families and go to bed without an aching\nstomach, we would rather live here than in the fields that\ngave us no grain,\u201d say a group of women in tattered saris\nwhen I ask them why they left their beautiful land of green\nfields and rivers. Wherever they find food, they pitch their\ntents that become transit homes. Children grow up in them,\nbecoming partners in survival. And survival in Seemapuri\nmeans rag-picking. Through the years, it has acquired the\nproportions of a fine art. Garbage to them is gold. It is their\ndaily bread, a roof over their heads, even if it is a leaking\nroof. But for a child it is even more.\n\u201cI sometimes find a rupee, even a ten-rupee note,\u201d\nSaheb says, his eyes lighting up. When you can find a\nsilver coin in a heap of garbage, you don\u2019t stop scrounging,\nfor there is hope of finding more.

Some might make\nquite extravagant claims for it as being, in its highest form,\na source of truth, and, in its practice, an art. Others,\nusually celebrities who see themselves as its victims, might\ndespise the interview as an unwarranted intrusion into\ntheir lives, or feel that it somehow diminishes them, just\nas in some primitive cultures it is believed that if one\ntakes a photographic portrait of somebody then one is\nstealing that person\u2019s soul.
