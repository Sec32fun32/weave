# Arxiv PDF Summarization Bot using Chain of Density

Academic researchers often need to quickly grasp the key ideas and contributions of scientific papers, but manually reading and summarizing long technical documents is time-consuming. This cookbook demonstrates how to build an AI-powered summarization bot that can extract concise, information-dense summaries from Arxiv papers using the Chain of Density technique.

We'll use the following tools to build our summarization pipeline:

- [Anthropic's Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/) for large language model capabilities
- [Arxiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/) to fetch paper metadata and PDFs
- [PyPDF2](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/) for PDF text extraction
- [Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave/) for experiment tracking and evaluation

The Chain of Density technique iteratively refines summaries to increase information density while maintaining coherence. We'll apply this approach to generate high-quality summaries of Arxiv papers that capture key methodologies, novel contributions, and potential impact.
