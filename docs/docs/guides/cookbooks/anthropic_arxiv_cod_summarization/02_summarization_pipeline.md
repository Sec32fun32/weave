# Summarization Pipeline

In this section, we'll implement the Chain of Density (CoD) summarization pipeline for Arxiv papers. This advanced technique iteratively refines summaries to increase information density while maintaining coherence.

## Chain of Density Summarization

The core of our summarization pipeline is the `chain_of_density_summarization` function. Here's an overview of its key components:

```python
@weave.op()
def chain_of_density_summarization(instruction, text, model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", chunk_size=8192, chunk_iterations=2, density_iterations=2):
    # ... (function implementation)
```

This function takes the following parameters:
- `instruction`: The specific focus or question for the summary
- `text`: The full text of the paper, including image descriptions
- `model`: The Anthropic model to use (default: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
- `chunk_size`: The size of text chunks for processing
- `chunk_iterations`: Number of iterations for chunk summarization
- `density_iterations`: Number of iterations for final density refinement

### Key Steps in the Pipeline

1. **Chunk Text**: The text is split into manageable chunks.

2. **Summarize Chunks**: Each chunk is summarized iteratively, focusing on the given instruction.

3. **Combine Chunk Summaries**: The individual chunk summaries are combined and refined.

4. **Iterative Density Refinement**: The combined summary undergoes multiple iterations of density improvement.

5. **Final Summary**: A last pass creates an extremely dense, final summary.

## ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline Model

To encapsulate our summarization logic and make it easier to experiment with, we create a Weave Model:

```python
class ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline(weave.Model):
    model: str = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
    chunk_size: int = 20000
    chunk_iterations: int = 1
    density_iterations: int = 3
    use_cache: bool = False
    cache: dict = {}

    # ... (constructor and predict method)
```

The `predict` method of this model:
1. Extracts images from the paper
2. Replaces image references with their descriptions
3. Applies the Chain of Density summarization
4. Optionally caches results for efficiency

## Usage

To use the summarization pipeline:

```python
pipeline = ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline()
result = pipeline.predict(arxiv_paper, instruction)
```

The `result` will contain:
- `final_summary`: The highly dense final summary
- `accumulated_summary`: The summary before the final refinement
- `iteration_summaries`: Summaries from each density iteration
- `chunk_iteration_summaries`: Summaries from each chunk iteration
- `chunk_summaries`: Individual summaries of each text chunk

This pipeline allows for flexible, instruction-focused summarization of Arxiv papers, leveraging the power of large language models to create highly informative and concise summaries.
