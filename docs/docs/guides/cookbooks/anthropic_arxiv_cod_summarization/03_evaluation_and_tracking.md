# Evaluation and Tracking

In this section, we'll implement an evaluation pipeline to assess the quality of our Chain of Density (CoD) summarization results and track experiments using Weave.

## Quality Scorer

```python
@weave.op()
def quality_scorer(instruction, model_output, model="gpt-4o"):
    openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    
    def score_summary(summary, summary_type):
        # ... (scoring logic)

    def calculate_long_tail_stats(scores):
        # ... (long tail statistics calculation)

    def analyze_iteration_impact(scores):
        # ... (iteration impact analysis)

    def find_optimal_improvement_range(scores):
        # ... (optimal improvement range calculation)

    def flatten_dict(d, parent_key='', sep='_'):
        # ... (dictionary flattening logic)

    scores = {
        "accumulated_summary": {},
        "final_summary": {}
    }

    try:
        # Process chunk summaries
        for i, chunk_list in enumerate(model_output["chunk_summaries"]):
            chunk_summary_scores = []
            for j, summary in enumerate(chunk_list):
                chunk_summary_score = score_summary(summary, f"Chunk Summary {i+1}.{j+1}")
                chunk_summary_scores.append(chunk_summary_score)
            scores[f"chunk_summaries_analysis_{i+1}"] = {
                "long_tail_stats": calculate_long_tail_stats(chunk_summary_scores),
            }

        # Score accumulated summary
        scores["accumulated_summary"] = score_summary(model_output["accumulated_summary"], "Accumulated Summary")

        # Score final summary
        scores["final_summary"] = score_summary(model_output["final_summary"], "Final Summary")

        # Flatten scores for easier analysis
        scores = flatten_dict(scores)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in quality_scorer: {str(e)}")
        scores["error"] = str(e)

    return scores
```

1. `score_summary(summary, summary_type)`:
   - Purpose: Evaluates individual summaries based on relevance, technical quality, and conciseness.
   - Process: Uses a large language model to assess the summary against specific criteria.
   - Importance: Provides a quantitative measure of summary quality, essential for comparing different stages of the summarization process.

2. `calculate_long_tail_stats(scores)`:
   - Purpose: Analyzes the distribution of scores across multiple summaries.
   - Metrics: Calculates mean, median, and tail ratio for each scoring aspect.
   - Significance: Identifies consistency and outliers in summary quality, crucial for understanding the overall performance of the summarization process.

3. `analyze_iteration_impact(scores)`:
   - Purpose: Evaluates the effect of each iteration on summary quality.
   - Metrics: Calculates mean improvement, diminishing returns point, cumulative improvement, and improvement variability.
   - Importance: Determines the optimal number of iterations for refinement, preventing unnecessary computational expense.

4. `find_optimal_improvement_range(scores)`:
   - Purpose: Identifies the range of iterations with the most significant quality improvement.
   - Process: Uses a moving average to find the most effective improvement period.
   - Significance: Optimizes the refinement process by focusing on the most productive iterations.

5. `find_optimal_score_range(scores)`:
   - Purpose: Determines the range of iterations that lead to the highest quality summary.
   - Process: Identifies the highest score and backtracks to find the optimal starting point.
   - Importance: Pinpoints the most effective part of the summarization process, allowing for potential optimization of earlier stages.

The `quality_scorer` function integrates these components to provide a comprehensive evaluation:

1. Chunk Summaries Analysis:
   - Evaluates each chunk summary individually.
   - Calculates long-tail statistics for each chunk iteration.
   - Identifies which chunks are summarized most effectively and consistently.

2. Accumulated Summary Evaluation:
   - Assesses the quality of the combined summary of all chunks.
   - Measures how well the individual chunk summaries are integrated.

3. Final Summary Evaluation:
   - Provides a final quality assessment of the entire summarization process.
   - Determines if the refinement process successfully improved the summary quality.

By analyzing these metrics, you can definitively:
1. Determine the optimal chunk size for initial summarization.
2. Identify the most effective number of iterations for both chunk summarization and density refinement.
3. Assess the overall improvement in summary quality from raw chunks to the final, refined summary.
4. Pinpoint specific areas where the summarization process may be underperforming.

## Weave Dataset and Evaluation

We create a Weave Dataset to store our evaluation data:

```python
dataset = weave.Dataset(name="we-paper-reading-eval-data", rows=[
    {"paper": arxiv_paper, "instruction": instruction, "summary": arxiv_paper.summary} 
    for arxiv_paper, instruction in eval_data
])
```

Then, we set up and run the evaluation:

```python
evaluation = weave.Evaluation(dataset=dataset, scorers=[quality_scorer])
for model in models:
    arxiv_chain_of_density_pipeline = ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline(model=model)
    await evaluation.evaluate(arxiv_chain_of_density_pipeline)
```

This evaluation process:
1. Applies our CoD pipeline to each paper in the dataset
2. Scores the resulting summaries using the quality scorer
3. Tracks results for different models and configurations

## Analyzing Results

The evaluation provides detailed metrics for each summary, including:
- Relevance scores
- Technical quality scores
- Conciseness scores
- Long-tail statistics for chunk summaries
- Model latency

These results are automatically logged and can be viewed in the Weave UI, allowing for easy comparison of different models and configurations.

## Conclusion

By implementing this evaluation pipeline, we can:
1. Quantitatively assess the quality of our CoD summaries
2. Compare performance across different models and hyperparameters
3. Track experiments and results over time
4. Identify areas for improvement in our summarization pipeline

This systematic approach to evaluation ensures that we can continually refine and improve our Arxiv paper summarization system, delivering high-quality, dense summaries tailored to specific research instructions.
