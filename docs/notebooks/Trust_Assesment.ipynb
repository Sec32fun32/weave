By breaking down the answers into simpler\n","statements and checking each one against the retrieved context, we quantified how much we can\n","**trust** the responses provided by the system.\n","\n"," **How Weave Helps**:\n","\n"," Weave played a crucial role in this process by:\n","\n"," - **Tracking**: Weave's `@weave.op()` decorators allowed us to track the inputs and outputs of our\n","   functions seamlessly. This provided transparency into each step of our pipeline.\n"," - **Evaluation**: Using Weave's `Evaluation` class, we conducted structured evaluations and stored\n","   the results in the **'eval'** section. This made it easy to analyze and compare results.\n"," - **Reproducibility**: By defining our prompts and models as Weave Objects and Models, we ensured\n","   that our pipeline is reproducible and easily shareable.\n","\n"," **Benefits of Weave Integration**:\n","\n"," - **Enhanced Trust**: By integrating faithfulness evaluation, we added an extra layer of **trust** to\n","   our system. Users can be more confident in the accuracy of the responses.\n"," - **Debugging and Improvement**: Weave's tracking capabilities make it easier to identify areas\n","  where the model may not be performing as expected, facilitating targeted improvements.\n","- **Comprehensive Insights**: The ability to store and analyze evaluation results within Weave\n","   provides comprehensive insights into model performance over time.\n","\n"," ---\n","\n"," ## 🔚 Final Thoughts\n","\n"," By integrating **Weave** into our code, we've enhanced the transparency, reliability, and\n"," **trustworthiness** of our RAG system. We can:\n","\n"," - Track function inputs and outputs.\n"," - Reuse prompt templates as Weave Objects.\n"," - Perform comprehensive evaluations focused on faithfulness.\n"," - Define an end-to-end pipeline as a Weave Model for easier evaluation.\n"," - Store evaluation results in the **'eval'** section of Weave for better analysis.\n","\n"," This approach not only provides valuable insights into the trustworthiness of the generated\n"," answers but also contributes to building systems that users can rely on with confidence.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
