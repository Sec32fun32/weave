# Feedback Data Model

This document outlines an investigation designed to inform the datamodel changes / usage Feedback in Weave.

## Current Data Model

Today, Feedback has a very simple data model (see weave/trace_server/migrations/003_feedback.up.sql):

```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    /*
    `id`: The unique identifier for the feedback. This is a UUID.
    */
    id String,

    /*
    `project_id`: The project identifier for the ref. This is an internal
    identifier that matches the project identifier in the W&B API.
    It is stored for feedback to allow efficient permissions filtering.
    */
    project_id String,

    /*
    `weave_ref`: The ref the feedback is associated with.
    Note: the weave prefix is to avoid conflict with React's notion of ref.
    */
    weave_ref String,

    /*
    `wb_user_id`: The ID of the user account used to authenticate the feedback creation.
    This is the ID of the user in the W&B API.
    */
    wb_user_id String,

    /*
    `creator`: The name to display for who the feedback came from. Can default to the name of
    the user account used to authenticate the feedback creation, but can be an arbitrary string.
    This is useful for feedback that originated with end users who may not have a W&B account.
    */
    creator String NULL,

    /*
    `created_at`: The time that the row was inserted into the database.
    */
    created_at DateTime64(3) DEFAULT now64(3),

    /*
    `feedback_type`: The type of feedback that was given. The prefix "wandb." is reserved for our use.
    */
    feedback_type String,

    /*
    `payload_dump`: A dictionary of values that represent the feedback.
    The schema of this dictionary is determined by the feedback_type.
    */
    payload_dump String,

) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (project_id, weave_ref, wb_user_id, id);
```

And there are 4 types of structured feedback (patten is split, but should be unified):

```python
# weave/trace_server/feedback.py
FEEDBACK_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS: dict[str, type[BaseModel]] = {
    "wandb.reaction.1": tsi.FeedbackPayloadReactionReq,
    "wandb.note.1": tsi.FeedbackPayloadNoteReq,
}
```

```python
# weave/trace_server/interface/base_models/feedback_base_model_registry.py

# Implied type name: `ActionScore`

class ActionScore(BaseModel):
    configured_action_ref: str
    output: Any
```

```python
# weave/trace/feedback_types/score.py
SCORE_TYPE_NAME = "wandb.score.beta.1"

class ScoreTypePayload(TypedDict):
    name: str
    op_ref: str
    call_ref: str
    results: dict
```

The incoming `payload` is expected (and enforced) to conform to the schema for the given `feedback_type`. However, in the emoji case, some post procesing is applied:

```python
def feedback_create(self, req: tsi.FeedbackCreateReq) -> tsi.FeedbackCreateRes:
    assert_non_null_wb_user_id(req)
    validate_feedback_create_req(req)

    feedback_type = req.feedback_type
    res_payload = req.payload

    for feedback_base_model in feedback_base_models:
        if base_model_name(feedback_base_model) == feedback_type:
            res_payload = base_model_dump(
                feedback_base_model.model_validate(res_payload)
            )
            break

    # Augment emoji with alias.
    if req.feedback_type == "wandb.reaction.1":
        em = req.payload["emoji"]
        if emoji.emoji_count(em) != 1:
            raise InvalidRequest(
                "Value of emoji key in payload must be exactly one emoji"
            )
        req.payload["alias"] = emoji.demojize(em)
        detoned = detone_emojis(em)
        req.payload["detoned"] = detoned
        req.payload["detoned_alias"] = emoji.demojize(detoned)
        res_payload = req.payload
```

Therefore, the on-disk shape is not technically typed or enforced at least for the emoji case

Finally, we should note that it is technically possible for the user to create their own feedback type name and payload that is completely arbitrary.


## Limitations / Complications

Until now, everything has been relatively adhoc in terms of consuming feedback in the UI and only support querying feedback itself. This presents a few complications:

1. We don't have a way to filter / sort calls based on feedback.
2. Dynamic Feedback types don't have a constent output shape, making their "type" mean something different than it does for emoji and note. (see section below)
3. Emoji's have a different shape on disk than their incoming shape constraints.

### Dynamic Feedback Types 

Let's consider the following new types of feedback:
1. (Emojis) `wandb.reaction.1`
    * Static Schema
    * Used in production & UI
    * Write-time enforced schema
2. (Notes) `wandb.note.1`
    * Static Schema
    * Used in production & UI
    * Write-time enforced schema
3. (Offline User-executed Scores) `wandb.score.beta.1`
    * Dynamic Schema
    * Not currently consumed - can be changed
    * Not enforced at write-time
4. (Online Weave-executed Scores) `ActionScore`
    * Dynamic Schema
    * No writers or consumers - can be changed
    * Write-time enforced schema
5. (Human-in-the-loop / Human Annotation Scores) `ConfiguredColumn`
    * Dynamic Schema
    * Not implemented in this branch (coming soon with Griffin's work)

Let's put to the side the naming format inconsistency for now and focus on what we mean by a "dynamic schema". Feeback types with a dynamic schema have some (or all) of their schema defined by user-specified configuration. For example:

* `wandb.score.beta.1` -> this is the result of running arbitrary user code, so the output schema is completely dynamic - from primitives to nested objects.
* `ActionScore` -> this is the result of running configured actions (which can be json-schema validated llm judgements).
* `ConfiguredColumn` -> this is the result of running a user-specified column (such as a rank, boolean, classification, etc).

In these cases, the user-specified configuration is identieed (NOT DEFINED ALWAYS) by a Weave object in the user's project. For example:

* All scorers generated by an Op with id `my_op:digest_1` would be expected to produce a consistent schema, but the schema itself is not stored
* All action scorers with the same action id `my_action:digest_1` are expected to produce the same schema (and in many cases is stored as json schema - nice!)
* All configured columns with the same column id `my_column:digest_1` are expected to produce the same schema, which is stored as more of a configuration object.

So now we have a logical mismatch between the "dynamic schema" and the "static schema" feedback types. While this all might seem pedantic, it's actually quite important for considering efficient and correct queries. This brings us to the next section.

### Additional Considerations

* Some scorers will need to have additionl context (for example ground truth labels) that need to be associated with the feedback.

## Querying Feedback

### Example Data
Let's consider that a call might have a number of feedbacks associated with it. For example (note, project-id, creator, and created_at are excluded for brevity):
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>weave_ref</th>
    <th>wb_user_id</th>
    <th>feedback_type</th>
    <th>payload_dump</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fb_001</td>
    <td>call:abc</td>
    <td>wb_001</td>
    <td>wandb.reaction.1</td>
    <td><pre>
{"emoji": "üëç"}</pre></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fb_002</td>
    <td>call:abc</td>
    <td>wb_001</td>
    <td>wandb.note.1</td>
    <td><pre>
{"note": "Great result!"}</pre></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fb_003</td>
    <td>call:abc</td>
    <td>wb_001</td>
    <td>wandb.score.beta.1</td>
    <td><pre>
{
    "name": "my_score",
    "op_ref": "my_op:digest_1", 
    "call_ref": "score_call:def",
    "results": {
        "is_correct": true
    }
}</pre></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fb_004</td>
    <td>call:abc</td>
    <td>wb_001</td>
    <td>ActionScore</td>
    <td><pre>
{
    "configured_action_ref": "my_action:digest_1",
    "output": {
        "grade": "A"
    }
}</pre></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>fb_002</td>
    <td>call:abc</td>
    <td>wb_001</td>
    <td>ConfiguredColumn</td>
    <td><pre>
{
    "configured_column_ref": "my_column:digest_1",
    "output": {
        "score": 0.98
    }
}</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Query considerations:
* Different queries have different requirements in terms of grouping and aggregating. For example:
   * Emojis: you want to group by emoji value, then count the unique user ids.
   * Notes: no grouping, just list all.
   * Scores/Actions: group by scorer name (optionally version), then apply a function (last, avg, etc).
   * ConfiguredColumns: group by column name, then apply a function (last, avg, etc). Optionally group by users.

### Example Queries

* "Given a Call, return all feedback"
* "Given a Call, return feedback columns"
* "Given a Call, return feedback for specific (type/version & group)(s)"
* "Given a Call query, include feedback for specific (type/version & group fn)(s)"
* "Given a Call query, sort feedback for specific (type/version & group fn)(s)"
* "Given a Call query, filter feedback for specific (type/version & group fn)(s)"

### Anticipated problems:
* The `type` column (as is) is insufficient for uniquely defining the column. (eg. not all `ConfiguredColumns should be grouped together.)
* The free-form schema of dynamic columns means that we will likely encounter key-space collisions in the nested objects - impliing that we need a mechanism to further narrow the space when querying.
* Since the feedback column is just a string dump of json, anytime we want to fetch feedback we need to parse the json. If critical keys lie in this json, then we will need to load the entire column into memory to perform operations, which will be too slow.

### Proposed Solutions

1. ("RefAsFields"): For dynamic columns, we store the additional grouping/metatadata as fields in the the payload. (This is the current design).
   * The main problem here is that getting the value of any speicfic feedback column requires loading the entire column into memory.
2. ("RefAsType"): For dynamic columns, use the specific object ref as the type name.
   * This will allow for indexed lookups for specific columns.
   * Question: can we effieciently prefix-match to group all versions?
   * Problem: assuming the query looks like `feedback.name:[version|*].path.to.key`, then our existing type names will be a problem.
   * Possible problem: it is not possible to distinguish between Actions, Scorers, and ConfiguredColumns.
   * Possible problem: if we want to put more metadata about the specific feedback, it nees to be placed as siblings in the payload, which excludes primitives from ever being used/stored. Also, effectively untyped and could cause key collisions. For example:
   ```json
   {
    _scorer_context: {"label": "ground truth"},
    is_correct: true
   }
   ```
3. ("RefAsKey"): For dynamic columns, we could store the "object/version" as the first two keys of the payload. For example:
   ```json
   {
    "my_action": {
        "digest_1": {
            "_scorer_context": {"label": "ground truth"},
            "value": {
                "grade": "A"
            }
        }
    }
   }
   ```
   * For this to be more efficient than #1, we would need to migrate to clickhouse's native json format (need to validate hypothesis here). This would allow the query syntax to be more natural (but does require an extra "value" key for these cases.): `feedback.my_action.digest_1.value.grade`. or `feedback.my_action.*.value.grade` to get the first value.
   * Also, getting all the feedback columns would then require a querying the json key space (need to investigate performance here).
   * One very nice property of this model is that you can group by call_ref, and do a dictionary merge on the results to get a compbined feedback object for each call.
4. ("RefAsColumns"): For dynamic columns, we could store the "object/version" as new columns in the table. This is very similar to #3, but directly encodes the object/version as columns - taking advantage of the direct indexing capabilities of clickhouse.

# TODOs

Cleanups:

* [ ] Unify the naming format for feedback types
* [ ] Unify the feedback validation logic (Tim unintentionally made this less dry)
* [ ] Add scorer feedback type to this formal definition.
* [ ] wb_user_id should be nullable (for actions)
* [ ] Could migrate the types to explude dots(.) - to avoid conflict with json selectors.
